An app I made in Swift and SwiftUI that utilizes CoreLocation.

Cruiser is a mobile application that allows bikers and e-skaters to track their ride paths and statistics on a trip that they take. The application will track the traversed path, distance, userâ€™s speed, and other statistics at different increments of the trip. A user is also able to search and find directions to a location while on the trip for navigation convenience. A key feature of Cruiser is allowing the application to start tracking trips in the background, allowing a user to view all their previous trips on their skateboards or bikes without manually pressing a button to start their trip. Each trip can be saved can be reviewed later by the user. A potential stretch goal is to allow users to orient the phone so that it points in the direction that the user is traveling in. The goal of the application is to make rides and skates more memorable and enjoyable for casual and daily riders.
